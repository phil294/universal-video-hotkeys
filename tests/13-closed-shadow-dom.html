<p>Video inside a closed shadow root. Hotkeys should still work as we're forcing them all open.</p>

<div id="closed-shadow-host"></div>

<script>
let host = document.getElementById('closed-shadow-host')
let shadow = host.attachShadow({ mode: 'closed' })
shadow.innerHTML = `
	<video controls width="600" height="400" src="test-video.mp4"></video>
